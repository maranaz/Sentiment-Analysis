Speaker A: Hey, did you see the weather forecast for today?
Speaker B: Yeah, um, it's supposed to rain in the afternoon.
Speaker A: You know, I was planning to go for a run later.
Speaker B: Same here. I guess we’ll have to change our plans.
Speaker A: It's been like, really unpredictable this week.
Speaker B: Totally. Yesterday it was sunny, and then suddenly it poured.
Speaker A: I got caught in that! Didn't even have my umbrella.
Speaker B: I hate when that happens. My shoes were soaked.
Speaker A: They say the weekend should be clear though.
Speaker B: Oh, that's good. I was thinking of going hiking.
Speaker A: Um, do you think it’s still too muddy on the trails?
Speaker B: Probably, but maybe by Sunday it'll be fine.
Speaker A: Honestly, I prefer cooler weather for outdoor stuff.
Speaker B: Yeah, me too. Summer heat is just exhausting.
Speaker A: I guess we just have to keep checking the forecast.
Speaker B: For sure. Fingers crossed for a dry weekend!
